![Optimal Confidence](https://github.com/danielgural/optimal_confidence_threshold/blob/main/assets/conf_output.png)

This plugin is a Python plugin that allows for you to find the optimal confidence threshold for deploying your models!

ðŸ”Ž Find the magic number in one click!

## Installation

```shell
fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/danielgural/optimal_confidence_threshold
```

## Operators

### `optimal_conf_threshold`

Finding the optimal confidence threshold can always be tricky. One way to consider doing so is finding the number that maximizes your F1 score. This plugin implements a method of running an optimized version of FiftyOne's `evaluate_detections` [method](https://docs.voxel51.com/api/fiftyone.core.dataset.html?highlight=evaluate%20detections#fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.evaluate_detections). This will calculate the F1 score at different thresholds until the best one is found! Here is how it works!

![Confidence Inputs](https://github.com/danielgural/optimal_confidence_threshold/blob/main/assets/conf_inputs.png)

Input the following:
- Lower bound to search between
- Upper bound to search between
- Number of thresholds to check, this will increase complexity
- Ground Truth field
- Prediction field

The plugin will then sweep your range for the optimal confidence threshold until the answer is popped out!
